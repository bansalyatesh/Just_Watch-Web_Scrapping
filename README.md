# Just Watch-Web Scrapping


Overview
This project is aimed at scraping data from the JustWatch website, a popular platform for streaming content information. The data scraped includes information about movies, TV shows, and streaming platforms available on JustWatch.

# Requirements           
Python 3.x            
Beautiful Soup 4         
Requests        

# Data Cleaning and Manipulation       
After scraping the data, certain cleaning and manipulation techniques can be applied to improve its quality and usefulness. These techniques may include:

Removing duplicate entries          
Handling missing or null values       
Standardizing text fields (e.g., converting titles to title case)      
Extracting relevant information (e.g., extracting genres from descriptions)          
Normalizing data (e.g., converting dates to a standardized format)      
The data cleaning and manipulation process may be implemented within the justwatch_scraper.py script or in separate data preprocessing scripts depending on the complexity of the tasks.
